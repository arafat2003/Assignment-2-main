                        <p>The UEFA Euro 2020 Final was a football match played at Wembley Stadium in London, England, on 11 July 2021 to determine
                        the winner of UEFA Euro 2020. It was the 16th final of the UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial tournament
                        contested by the senior men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA to decide the champions of Europe.
                        In front of a crowd of 67,173, Italy won their second European Championship, beating final debutants England 3–2 in a
                        penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after extra time. England's Luke Shaw opened the scoring in the second minute of
                        the match, the fastest goal ever scored in a European Championship final, only for Leonardo Bonucci – who was later
                        named the man of the match – to equalise midway through the second half.</p>
